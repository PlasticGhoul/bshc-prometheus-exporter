# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for all versions, since there is only one right now.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will address them promptly.

To report a vulnerability, create an issue with the details of the vulnerability and any steps required to reproduce it.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure.
